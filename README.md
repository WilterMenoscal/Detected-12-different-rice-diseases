# Detected-12-different-rice-diseases
Implementation of resnet 50 model to generate a model that detects different rice diseases by means of photos.

Originally, the paper on which we rely has two versions, a public dataset and a paid dataset, the public dataset is a short version of the original dataset, which can be found at the following link:

However, if you have access to IEEEDataport, you can find the original dataset at the following link:

Now, in order to replicate our model, initially there is an .ipynb file in which each part implemented in our model is mentioned, in order to replicate the results.
